# Anouk commandline:
cufflinks -p 10 -o ${pathResults}cufflinksWOMT --max-bundle-length 10000000 --multi-read-correct --library-type \"fr-firststrand\" -b ${pathForFasta}${genome}.fa  --no-effective-length-correction -M ${path}MTmouse.gtf -G $gtfFile ${pathResults}Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
# In fact only quantifying the gtf is sufficient so we will use -G instead of -g
Cufflinks 2.2.1.3 to fit what Anouk was using: 

Use Ref annotation: Use reference annotation
Perform bias correction: yes
Use multi-read correct: yes
Apply length correction: Standard length correction
Set advanced -> yes
Library -> fr-firststrand
Mask file -> MT
Inner mean distance -> 200
Inner distance standard deviation -> 80
Maximum genomic length of a given bundle -> 10000000

# STAR:
STAR 2.7.7a to fit what we use (ENCODE):

Length of the genomic sequence around annotated junctions -> 99
Per gene/transcript output -> GeneCount
Read alignment tags to include in the BAM output -> unclick ch
MAPQ value for unique mappers -> 255
Exclude the following records from the BAM output -> Unmapped reads
Would you like to set additional output filters? -> YES
Would you like to keep only reads that contain junctions that passed filtering? -> yes
Maximum number of alignments to output a read's alignment results, plus 1 -> 20
Maximum number of mismatches to output an alignment, plus 1 -> 999
Maximum ratio of mismatches to read length -> 0.04
Algorithmic settings:
Extended
Alignment parameters
Minimum intron size -> 20
Maximum intron size -> 1000000
Maximum gap between two mates -> 1000000
Minimum overhang for spliced alignments -> 8
Minimum overhang for annotated spliced alignments -> 1
