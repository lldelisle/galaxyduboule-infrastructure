# galaxyduboule-infrastructure

Here is stored everything needed to maintain galaxyduboule or reinstall it from scratch.

galaxyduboule.epfl.ch was reinstalled from scratch 20210309 following [fromScratch.sh](./fromScratch.sh). I put all the steps but also all the tricks I needed to use to make old tools working.

To maintain the server, everything is written there [maintain_galaxy.md](./maintain_galaxy.md).

The workflows are now available at [https://github.com/lldelisle/myNGSanalysis/](https://github.com/lldelisle/myNGSanalysis/).

Some tips mainly for me are at [tips.md](./tips.md).
